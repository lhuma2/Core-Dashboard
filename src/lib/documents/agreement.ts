The Provider invoices by email following each service cycle, and invoices are due within the payment period stated in the Particulars.

All amounts are exclusive of GST unless stated otherwise.' },

All Provider personnel are bound by confidentiality obligations and handle client credentials and site information with discretion." },
  { n: 13, title: 'Subcontracting & Assignment', body: "The Provider may subcontract performance of the Services but remains responsible for the Services performed.

Nothing in this clause limits rights that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law." },

It constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes prior discussions. Any variation must be in writing and signed by both parties.
