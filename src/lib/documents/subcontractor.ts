  intro:
    'This Agreement sets out the terms on which the Subcontractor provides cleaning services to Core Cleaning as an independent contractor. By signing, the Subcontractor agrees to be bound by these terms.',
  clauses: [
    { n: 1, title: 'Engagement & Independent Contractor Status', body: 'Core Cleaning engages the Subcontractor to perform cleaning services at sites allocated from time to time. The Subcontractor is an independent contractor, not an employee, partner or agent of Core Cleaning. The Subcontractor is responsible for their own tax, superannuation, insurances and business costs, and is free to accept or decline allocated work.' },
    { n: 2, title: 'Services & Standards', body: 'The Subcontractor will perform the services to a professional commercial standard, in accordance with the site scope, Core Cleaning’s procedures and any reasonable direction as to the result required. The Subcontractor provides their own skill, method and supervision. Deficiencies notified within a reasonable time will be rectified at the Subcontractor’s cost.' },
    { n: 3, title: 'Fees, Invoicing & Payment', body: 'Core Cleaning will pay the agreed fee for completed services. The Subcontractor invoices Core Cleaning (with a valid ABN and, where registered, GST) per the agreed cycle. Payment is made within the agreed payment period to the Subcontractor’s nominated account. The Subcontractor is not entitled to leave, allowances or employment entitlements.' },
    { n: 4, title: 'Insurance', body: 'The Subcontractor must hold and maintain current Public Liability insurance of not less than $10 million, and Workers’ Compensation insurance where they engage workers, for the term of this Agreement. Certificates of Currency must be provided to Core Cleaning on request and kept current. Work must not be performed while cover has lapsed.' },
    { n: 5, title: 'Work Health & Safety', body: 'The Subcontractor will comply with the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Qld) and related regulations, Core Cleaning’s Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS) and Safety Data Sheets (SDS), and all site safety rules. The Subcontractor is responsible for the safety of their own personnel and for reporting incidents and hazards promptly.' },
    { n: 6, title: 'Confidentiality & Non-Solicitation', body: 'The Subcontractor will keep confidential all client, site and business information and access credentials, and use them only to perform the services. During the term and for six months after, the Subcontractor will not directly solicit or service Core Cleaning’s clients introduced through this engagement without Core Cleaning’s written consent.' },
    { n: 7, title: 'Equipment, Materials & Chemicals', body: 'Unless otherwise agreed, the Subcontractor supplies their own equipment and materials, maintained in safe working order (electrical items tested and tagged). Chemicals must be used strictly per the SDS and correct dilution. The Subcontractor must not mix products or use unapproved chemicals on site.' },
    { n: 8, title: 'Conduct, Uniform & Presentation', body: 'The Subcontractor and their personnel will present neatly and professionally, wear the required uniform/ID where applicable, conduct themselves courteously on site, and respect client property and privacy. Behaviour that damages Core Cleaning’s reputation or a client relationship is a breach of this Agreement.' },
    { n: 9, title: 'Incident & Hazard Reporting', body: 'The Subcontractor will report any incident, injury, near-miss, damage or hazard to Core Cleaning management without delay, and cooperate with any investigation. Serious incidents must be reported immediately by phone.' },
    { n: 10, title: 'Subcontractor’s Personnel', body: 'The Subcontractor is responsible for the recruitment, vetting, right-to-work checks, training, induction, supervision and payment of their own personnel, and ensures each has read and understood the relevant induction and SWMS before commencing work.' },
    { n: 11, title: 'Compliance with Laws & Modern Slavery', body: 'The Subcontractor will comply with all applicable workplace, employment, tax and human-rights laws, and with Core Cleaning’s Modern Slavery position: no forced labour, child labour, human trafficking or exploitation in its operations or supply chain. Any suspected breach must be reported immediately.' },
    { n: 12, title: 'Liability & Indemnity', body: 'The Subcontractor indemnifies Core Cleaning against loss or claims arising from the Subcontractor’s negligence, breach of this Agreement, or the acts of its personnel. Each party is responsible for its own insurable risks. Nothing limits rights that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law.' },
    { n: 13, title: 'Term, Suspension & Termination', body: 'This Agreement applies from the date signed and continues until terminated. Either party may terminate on reasonable written notice. Core Cleaning may suspend or terminate immediately for a material breach, a lapse of insurance, a serious safety breach, or conduct that harms a client relationship. On termination the Subcontractor returns all keys, fobs, access devices and confidential material.' },
    { n: 14, title: 'GST, ABN & General', body: 'The Subcontractor warrants its ABN and, where applicable, GST registration. This Agreement is governed by the laws of Queensland. It is the entire agreement between the parties; any variation must be in writing. A failure to enforce a term is not a waiver. If a provision is unenforceable it is severed and the remainder continues. This Agreement may be signed electronically.' },
