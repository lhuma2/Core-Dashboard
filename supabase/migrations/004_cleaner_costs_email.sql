I hope things are going well.

I wanted to reach out because we''ve recently had a few clients take advantage of our specialist services — and I think they could add real value for {{business_name}} too.

We currently offer:
— Pressure washing (external surfaces, car parks, pathways)
— Carpet extraction (hot water extraction, stain treatment)
— Window washing (internal and external, frames and sills)
— Deep vinyl cleaning (machine scrub, strip and reseal)
— Female hygiene bin supply & servicing

All of these can be added to your existing schedule or done as a one-off. Happy to put together a quick quote if any of these are of interest.
